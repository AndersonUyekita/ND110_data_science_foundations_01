## Instructor

Python will be taught by Juno! As a data scientist, Juno built neural networks to analyze and categorize product images, a recommendation system to personalize shopping experiences for each user, and tools to generate insight into user behavior.

### Welcome To Introduction To Python!

In this course, we use Python version 3 (or simply Python 3). If you'd like more details on previous versions of Python and how version 3 differs from previous versions, check out the History of Python on Wikipedia. If you're new to Python or programming in general, this article will make more sense after you've completed a lesson or two, so you may want to hold off for now. All you need to know now is that your solution code for the programming exercises in this course will be graded based on Python 3 code.

### Programming In Python
As you learn Python throughout this course, there are a few things you should keep in mind.

* Python is case sensitive.
* Spacing is important.
* Use error messages to help you learn.

Let’s get started!
