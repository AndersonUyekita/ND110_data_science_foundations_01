## Requirements

All theses courses are quite extensive, so I decided to create for each of these courses one repository.

#### UD110 - Introduction to Python Programming

This course is almost the same of the `Lesson01_part01` and `Lesson02_part01` of  Data Science Foundations 01 with minor changes.

#### UD036 - Programming Foundations with Python

Awesome course with a different approach. I have stored all notes and `.py` files in a separeted repository.

#### CS101 - Intro to Computer Science

I have not visited the course website to evaluate the lessons.

## _The Data Analysis Process_

The Data Analysis Process is divided into 5 steps:

1. Question
2. Wrangle
3. Explore
4. Draw Conclusions
5. Communicate

This view it is the same presented by Roger Peng in Managing Data Analysis (a course of Executive Data Science Specialization), the next table shows a comparison between both:

**Table 1 - Comparison between methods**

|Step|Juno Lee|Roger Peng**|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|1|Question|Stating and refining the question|
|2|Wrangle|Exploring the data|
|3|Explore|Building formal statistical models|
|4|Draw Conclusions|Interpreting the results|
|5|Communicate|Communicating the results|

(**): Part of this table was extracted from the Coursera website.

The Figure 1 shows a summary of each step (this picture was picked from the book of Roger Peng called Art of Data Science).

Although the process has divided into 5 step, these step are not statics and usually this is not a linear from 1 to 5. There are a lot of iterations until the last step.

### Step 1 - Ask a Question

Usually all the analysis starts based on a question, which we would like to answer using data. This question must have 5 features:

* Interest
* Answerable
* Specific
* Pausible
* Not already answered

Keep in mind that the question must be specific. If the question is not specific, we must refine it.

### Step 2 - Wrangle

Here we perform the EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), discover some patterns, descriptive analysis

### Step 3



### Step 4




### Step 5
